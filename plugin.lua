-- This file is unused but since this plugin is a remote neovim plugin (implemented in vimscript, golang and typescript) it does not have a lua implementation.
-- However, I want it to be available on dotfyle.com, which has a constraint that all plugins must have a lua portion of the project on github.
-- So, I am adding this file to satisfy the constraint.
